Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForQuestionAnswering: ['cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForQuestionAnswering from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForQuestionAnswering from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForQuestionAnswering were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['qa_outputs.weight', 'qa_outputs.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
